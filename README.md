DiskMaker 8
===========

Formerly shareware, now freeware.

This was my coding project between 2004 - 2006.  Included in this archive are my developer, beta and the two public releases along with the source code for the final version.

The source code was assembled using ORCA/M 8-bit.  If you wish to build the code yourself, use the "GO" script from within ORCA.

Version History
===============

19 Aug. 2004 - Developer Release 1
---------------------------------
Early version that only had the file selection screen implemented, keyboard navigation only.  I sent this to a few friends for feedback.

30 Aug. 2004 - Developer Release 2
---------------------------------
Same as Dev 1 but by this time I had implemented the mouse interface.

10 March 2005 - Developer Release 3
-----------------------------------
About 90% of the functionality done by this point. Quite a few ways to make it crash but it could create disks.

18 March 2005 - Beta 1
----------------------
A week later I had fixed (what I thought were) my last bugs, removed debugging code and sent it to my beta testers.

23 March 2005 - Beta 2
----------------------
The bug reports came fast and furious and only 5 days later I put out a second beta.

23 April 2005 - Beta 3
----------------------
Sent to only one of my beta testers who found a bug in the 5.25" disk formatting routine.

9 Nov. 2005 - Beta 4
--------------------
Starting to ramp up to my first public release.  Squished a few more bugs.

20 Nov. 2005 - Pre-Release version
----------------------------------
Added the proper "About" screen and introduced a nasty bug in the process.  Also added a custom screen character printing routine which greatly improved performance.

3 Dec. 2005 - Version 1.0
-------------------------
First public release.

25 Jan. 2006 - Version 1.1
--------------------------
Major difference was replacing the standard 5.25" disk formatting routine with the quick Hyperformat by Jerry Hewett.  A few more minor bugs were killed.
